# Console Game Unity Revamp - Justin Farley
A while ago I made a [console game](https://github.com/justinfarley/ConsoleGame) in Java... Now, after getting my years of experience, it's time for an upgrade, in a game engine i can actually use. This repo is reserved for the Unity project that this game will become. (and it will be completely public! (_good for the resume_))


## Features:
* Will still be played in a terminal
* Weapons will be white/colorless and (maybe) pixelish to fit console theme
* 
*
