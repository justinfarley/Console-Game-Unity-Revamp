# Console Game Unity Revamp - Justin Farley
A while ago I made a [console game](https://github.com/justinfarley/ConsoleGame) in Java... Now, after getting my years of experience, it's time for an upgrade, in a game engine i can actually use. This repo is reserved for the Unity project that this game will become. (and it will be completely public! (_good for the resume_))

It will be a Solo game for now may incorporate [RLS](https://justin-portfolio.farley-family.com/RedLobsterStudios-Website/mainpage.html) later on, it will get marketed as an RLS game however

## Features:
* Will still be played in a terminal
* Weapons will be white/colorless and (maybe) pixelish to fit console theme
* Map will always be visible with arrows to move around or you can use the arrow keys

## Ideas:
* starts as USER~SERVER:// something like that in the console the path changes as you enter commands as well
* I wanna do inventory UI when you do the "see inv" command
* Explosions and other VFX / AUDIOFX when battling and using items to give it an interactive feel that would be sick
*
